# Möbius Wave Cosmology (MWC)

## A Unified Dual-Phase, Discrete-Time Framework for the Universe

---

## **Introduction**

The Möbius Wave Cosmology (MWC) arises from the recognition that the universe may not be governed by separate, competing forces, but by a single, unified information field whose geometry inverts across a dual-phase structure. The Möbius topology provides a physical metaphor and mathematical grounding: expansion and contraction are not opposites but mirror states of the same underlying field. MWC proposes that spacetime evolves in discrete temporal increments (Δt = tₚ), and that curvature, energy, and structure emerge from information density regulated through a topological inversion cycle.

This manuscript expands each chapter with detailed conceptual, mathematical, and predictive depth.

# **Chapter 1 — The Möbius Breath**

## 1.1 The Crisis of ΛCDM

The ΛCDM model successfully explains large-scale structure but relies on dark matter and dark energy—entities with no direct detection. The cosmological constant problem introduces a 120-orders-of-magnitude discrepancy between predicted and observed vacuum energy. These issues point toward missing underlying physics.

## 1.2 Möbius Topology as Physical Insight

A Möbius strip possesses one continuous surface and one continuous boundary. Its inversion represents the possibility that the universe cycles between concave (gravity-dominant) and convex (expansion-dominant) phases without requiring separate forces. This provides a topological basis for a self-regulating cosmos.

## 1.3 The Dual-Phase Field

The MWC field Φ evolves through discrete inversion:

```
Φ(n+1) = -β Φ(n)
```

where β ≈ 0.7 is a topological scaling factor emerging from information conservation. The negative sign represents the inversion—expansion to contraction and vice versa.

## 1.4 Replacing the Dark Sector

Rather than invoking dark entities, MWC attributes galactic rotation and cosmic acceleration to shifts in the information field’s curvature density, encoded as:

```
ρ_eff = ρ_baryonic / (1 - β)
```

This reproduces the observed matter-energy ratios.

# **Chapter 2 — Discrete Time**

## 2.1 The Planck Interval

Continuous time leads to divergences in quantum gravity. MWC enforces discreteness:

```
Δt = tₚ = 5.39 × 10⁻⁴⁴ s
```

This becomes the fundamental tick of the cosmic clock.

## 2.2 Consequences of Granular Time

* Maximum oscillation frequency:

```
ν_max = 1 / (2Δt)
```

* No infinite-energy vacuum modes
* Natural cutoff for field fluctuation spectra

## 2.3 Difference Equations

Instead of differential equations:

```
H(n) = (a(n+1) - a(n)) / (a(n) Δt)
```

All cosmological relations become stepwise and computable.

# **Chapter 3 — Information as Curvature**

## 3.1 The Information Universe

Curvature (R) corresponds to information density (I) [1,5] (I):

```
R ∝ ∂I/∂V
```

Regions of high information density curve spacetime.

## 3.2 Bekenstein Bound as Cosmic Constraint [1]

The universe cannot store infinite information. The bound is:

```
I ≤ 2πER / (ħc)
```

This regulates cosmic evolution.

## 3.3 Folds of Meaning

Black holes represent maximal curvature folds; voids represent maximal unfolds. Both extremes emerge from the same information field dynamics.

## 3.4 Holography and Möbius Structure [5]

The universe encodes itself on its boundary. The Möbius inversion ensures boundary information re-enters the bulk cyclically.

---

# **Chapter 4 — Emergent Gravity**

## 4.1 Gravity from Entropic Gradients [10,20]

Verlinde-like entropic gravity emerges naturally:

```
F = T ∂S/∂x
```

where information density determines entropic gradients.

## 4.2 From Unity to Forces

Initial unified field → Möbius inversion → structured fluctuations → apparent forces (electromagnetism, weak, strong). Gravity remains emergent.

## 4.3 Vacuum Geometry

Dark energy arises from inversion imbalance:

```
Λ_eff = β H²
```

No fine-tuning required.

---

# **Chapter 5 — Mathematical Framework**

## 5.1 Discrete-Time Friedmann Equation

```
H(n) = (a(n+1) - a(n)) / (a(n) Δt)
```

This replaces continuous H(t).

## 5.2 Modified Density Equation

```
H(n)^2 = (8πG/3) • (ρ / (1 - β))
```

This reproduces cosmic acceleration without dark energy.

## 5.3 Self-Regulation

Vacuum fluctuations cancel through inversion symmetry.

## 5.4 Numerical Simulation

Lattice implementation:

```
a(n+1) = a(n) (1 + H(n) Δt)
```

Simulations are stable, bounded, and finite.

# **Chapter 6 — Testable Predictions**

## 6.1 CMB Non-Gaussianity

Discrete transitions induce measurable *f*ₙₗ.

## 6.2 UHECR Maximum Energy Cutoff

Predicted cutoff:

```
E_max ≈ ħ / Δt
```

Aligns with observed suppression.

## 6.3 Information-Bounded Voids

Voids satisfy:

```
I_void ≈ Area / (4Għ)
```

Testable with Euclid.

## 6.4 Gravitational Wave Echoes

```
t_echo = GMΔt / c³
```

Echo delay increases with black hole mass.

## 7.2 Consciousness as Curvature Memory

Consciousness may arise from recursive information folds.
